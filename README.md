# Crowd Runner

## Description
Crowd Runner is a clone of the popular crowd-based runner game where players guide a character through an obstacle course while gathering more followers to form a larger crowd. The aim is to reach the end with as many followers as possible while avoiding obstacles, enemies, or traps that might reduce the size of your crowd.

This project has been created using Unity and is designed to replicate the mechanics and experience of similar crowd-based running games.

In this project, you can design levels from scratch using the **LevelDesigner** implemented with **ScriptableObject**. A custom UI toolkit was used for this purpose.
